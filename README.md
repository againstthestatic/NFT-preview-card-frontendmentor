## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Found this really useful as a first project. Nice to learn how to create and position an overlay with an image to use as a hover state.

### Continued development

Would be nice to explore other layouts as I tend to rely on flex.
